    "description": "The Spacestation is a multi-million dollar creator economy enterprise generating $12-16M annually across gaming, digital content, mobile apps, and merchandise. As Creative Director and Operations Lead, I built the company's integrated creative infrastructure from the ground upâ€”establishing cross-departmental workflows between creative (Nebula), product development (Labs), and content production (Satellite) teams that I hired and scaled to 30+ employees. My systems and strategic direction contributed to 300% subscriber growth (2M to 8M) on primary channels while managing projects spanning UI/UX for apps with 1M+ downloads, merchandise strategy, and co-founding new revenue streams including Spacestation Animation and Quarter Machine Web3 venture.",
