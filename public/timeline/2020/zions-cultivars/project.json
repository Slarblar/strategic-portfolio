    "description": "Zion Cultivars was looking for an organic, aesthetically pleasing, but representative logo of their brand and the state of Utah. After conceptualizing several logo concepts, we landed on a design that perfectly fit their requirements. The final badge logo features the mountains of Utah illustrated with clean, minimal lines as the backdrop, providing flexibility for using either the full badge or just the mountain elements alone. The flower accents serve as a subtle nod to \"flower,\" a term commonly used within the cannabis space. Zion Cultivars continues to be a staple leader in Utah's cannabis industry, proudly using this logo as they grow.",
