I initiated the project by hiring concept artists to develop the visual language, then collaborated with Joseph Burgan to implement an Unreal Engine-based pipeline concept—drawing from my successful consulting experiences with previous clients. Once the creative foundation was established, I brought in a studio director to handle day-to-day operations and team scaling, allowing me to focus on strategic oversight and cross-departmental coordination. For the theatrical premiere of \"Adley Lost in the Movies,\" I served as project lead, handling audio mixing/mastering, coordinating across multiple companies and departments, managing venue partnerships with Farmington Station for signage and logistics, and establishing Spacestation Animation's event presence. Throughout the project, I maintained hands-on involvement in critical production areas, including stepping in to create thumbnails when performance issues required immediate creative intervention, demonstrating the leadership flexibility necessary to ensure consistent quality across all brand touchpoints. I would like to thank the following collaborators for their immense work and efforts on Spacestation Animation and the A for Adley project: Nathan Riddle / Emily Riddle / Miles Milton / Nick Russo / Colby Lundgreen / Ian Vanwagoner / Curtis Cannon / Tanner Shelton / Mitch Shelton / Cameron Terry / Malcom Milton / Amber Kommavongsa",
